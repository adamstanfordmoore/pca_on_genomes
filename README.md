# PCA on Genome data
In this mini-project I used PCA to analyze 995 public DNA sequences of over 10,000 nucleobases from 10 distinct geographic regions and interpreted the first few principle components.
The first two principal components indicated geographic and historical relations, while the 3rd distinguished gender. The amplitude of the components of the third principal component indicated the position of the Y chromosome within the genetic sequence.  I also explored the differences between fitting via the 1st principal-component least-squares fitting.
